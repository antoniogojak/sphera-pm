## Description

This repository serves as an extension for the Sphera repository, focusing on projection mapping of virtual globe data. It includes configuration files tailored for Splash software (https://splashmapper.xyz/en/), enabling seamless projection mapping. Additionally, the repository provides sphere models with a 0.5 m radius for calibration and projection purposes.

## Features

*   **Projection Mapping Configuration:** Contains configuration files for Splash to facilitate projection mapping.
*   **Sphere Models:** Includes models of spheres with a 0.5 m radius, optimized for calibration and projection.
*   **Sample Earth Texture:** Provides a sample Earth texture for virtual globe projection.

## Tech Stack / Key Dependencies

The primary technologies used in this repository are related to projection mapping and 3D modeling. Key components include:

*   3D modeling project file (Blender)
*   JSON configuration files for projection mapping
*   OBJ models

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/antoniogojak/sphera-pm.git
    cd sphera-pm
    ```

2.  Ensure you have Splash installed and configured. Tested with Splash 0.11.2.

3.  Run command prompt from configuration folder and start Splash with

    ```bash
    splash ProjectorDouble_NoCalib.json
    ```

## Usage / Getting Started

1.  Use the provided `.json` configuration files with Splash to set up your projection mapping.
2.  Import the `.obj` sphere models into your preferred 3D software for further customization or adjustments.
3.  Utilize the `Sphere.blend` file in Blender if needed.

## Configuration

The `ProjectorDouble_NoCalib.json` file contains configuration settings for the Splash software. Modify this file to adjust the projection settings as needed.
